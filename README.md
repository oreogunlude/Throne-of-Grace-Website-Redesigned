# Throne-of-Grace-Website-Redesign

I redesigned a church's website by following the steps in the Software Development Life Cycle. 

Throne of Grace is a growing church that requires it's website to be strong tool for an online presence. It's goal is get new members to the church, build a stong brand image, have an excellent user experience, make donations easy, quick & simple for users, increase monthly partnerships and optimize it's website for desktop, tablet and mobile platforms.

## Website Features

### Call to Actions

The call to action buttons are located on the header of most pages on the website for easy access. These buttons allow users to easily perform the 2 main reasons why they visit the website. To watch an online service or making a donation to the church. The table below shows the pages for watching an online service and making a donation online after the user has used the call to action buttons to access these pages.

### 5-Click Maximum Donation Box

My goal for making donations was to ensure that users are able to make donations in a maximum of 5 clicks ensurining a smooth experience. I used visual media to represent sowing seeds and flowers blosoming due to growth. The previous version of the website did nott give users an easy option to choose where their donations go to so I included a dropdown option. This dropdown option consists of general offerings, tithes, specific minisrties and project funds.
